       Most people do not know how much calories are needed by their body, and they do not know the amount of calories contained in every food that they eat and even do not know that there are activities that can be done in order to burn out the calorie content in our body. Hence, an application has been developed to overcome these situations. 
        In the 21st century with ever growing technology, people are not able to pay attention towards their health due to which they become more prone to unhealthy lifestyle and hence leading to various health issues. The main purpose of this project is to provide a personalized web app which facilitates the individuals to track their daily calorie intake, achieve the desired goals and to reduce health problems, especially diabetes. This will also help them to keep a track of their health, exercise, fitness goals along with providing additional features like checking the BMI and BMR according to their age, height and weight.

      <p class="para">BMI is a measurement of a person's leanness or corpulence based on their height and weight, and is intended to quantify tissue mass. It is widely used as a general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height. Specifically, the value obtained from the calculation of BMI is used to categorize whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese depending on what range the value falls between. </p>

      <p class="para">Basal Metabolic Rate is the number of calories required to keep your body functioning at rest. BMR is also known as your body’s metabolism; therefore, any increase to your metabolic weight, such as exercise, will increase your BMR. To get your BMR, simply input your height, gender, age and weight below. Once you’ve determined your BMR, you can begin to monitor how many calories a day you need to maintain or lose weight.</p>

          <p class="para">Diabetes mellitus, commonly known as diabetes, is a metabolic disease that causes high blood sugar. The hormone insulin moves sugar from the blood into your cells to be stored or used for energy. With diabetes, your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t effectively use the insulin it does make.</p>
